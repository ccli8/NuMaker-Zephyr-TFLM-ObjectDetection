Notes on porting from BSP to Zephyr
***********************************

1. Search keywords below for relevant modifications

   - __ZEPHYR__
   - CONFIG_SOC_FAMILY_NUMAKER

2. Must enable FPU (CONFIG_FPU and friends) additionally to match BSP
   performance on inference pre-process/post-process
3. Configure MPU region for tensor arena in zephyr way rather than
   direct control
4. Use default ethosu_flush_dcache/ethosu_invalidate_dcache override provided
   in ethos-u zephyr driver
5. Place tensor arena at .noinit.tensor_arena section
6. Profile/PMU

   (1) ethosu_driver is encapsulated in ethos-u zephyr driver and is
       invisible from app. Acquire it by invoking ethosu_reserve_driver
       and ethosu_release_driver in pair transiently
   (2) SysTick is exclusively used by zephyr kernel. Use zephyr kernel
       timing api instead

8. ml-embedded-evaluation-kit

   (1) Change BufAttributes.hpp for model related code/data placement

       a. Place model at .rodata.tflm_model section
       b. Place tensor arena at .noinit.tflm_arena section
       c. Place input feature map at .rodata.tflm_input section
       d. Place labels at .rodata.tflm_labels section

   (2) Redirect ml-embedded-evaluation-kit logging to zephyr way
       NOTE: Zephyr logging doesn't open interface for disabling newline
       print, and this redirect has drawback of duplicate newline print.

9. ml-embedded-evaluation-kit/kws

   (1) Use MicroNetKwsMfcc instead of KwsMfcc
   (2) KwsPreProcess has API update on passing inference index
   (3) KwsPostProcess has API update on passing useSoftmax
   (4) Tweak KwsPostProcess to enable use or not of softmax

10.openmv

    (1) Base on M55M1 BSP V3.01.002 ThirdParty/openmv
    (2) Remove GCC/IAR/KEIL IDE projects and their build artifactts
    (3) Port mutex onto zephyr (N/A)
    (4) Remove unnecessary sensors/ from build (N/A)

11. Use shell instead of unsupported getchar
    Add shell commands "kws <subcommand>" for kws record control

12. Adjust memory size

    (1) Enlarge main stack size (CONFIG_MAIN_STACK_SIZE)
        NOTE: MPU fault may imply stack overflow.
    (2) Enable system heap (CONFIG_HEAP_MEM_POOL_SIZE)
        This is used for k_malloc in ethos-u driver overrides
        ethosu_mutex_create and ethosu_semaphore_create
